      "content": "Tardar Sauce (born April 4, 2012), commonly known as Grumpy Cat, is an American internet celebrity cat. She is known for her permanently \"grumpy\" facial appearance, which is caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism. She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on September 22, 2012, on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha Bundesen. Lolcats and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit users went viral. She is the subject of a popular internet meme in which negative, cynical images are made from photographs of her."
